\n\nApp by: David Brain
\nVersion: 1.0
\nReleased: July 4, 2014

\n\nThis app has two goals. The first is to provide you with a useful
mapping app that allows you to look at our world in three different
ways. In this app you can easily switch between three different map
providers: OpenStreetMap Standard, MapQuest Aerial and OpenStreetMap Cycle. In this app you can
change the map provider any time
you like. You can also drop markers on the map, and they will work
across all of the providers.

\n\nThe second goal is to demonstrate the abilities of the BA3 Mapping
Engine in a simple app. The BA3 Mapping Engine is a high-performance
library useful to any developer creating apps on iOS, Android and Windows
8 that use maps. As
you are using this app, note the speed, smoothness, stability and
performance of the engine. You can download a free copy of the SDK
along with sample source code and tutorials at http://BA3.us.
